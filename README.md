# Function-Approximation
Implement an algorithm to learn a specific game by a graph where every board state is a node and every move is an edge. The goal is to find the best move for each state. Based on that function, every state is assigned a value and, based on that value, the best move for each state is determined. Approximate this function only by training examples.
